# Pog-Man
The pac-man game I'm working on rn
Right now version 1.0 is out, it's somewhat of a bare bones version of the game.
In the future I'm going to have more interesting difficulty scaling of the levels and more items, but it's playable at the moment.
To play, download PyCharm, have the random, termcolor and time pips installed.
For a better playing experience, go to file, settings, search console font, click Use console font instead of the default, change the scheme to Darcula, set the size to 13 and the line height to 0.6.
