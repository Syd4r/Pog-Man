# Pog-Man
The pac-man game I'm working on rn
Right now version 1.0 is out, it's somewhat of a bare bones version of the game.
In the future I'm going to have more interesting difficulty scaling of the levels and more items, but it's playable at the moment.
To play, download the executable (windows defender says the program is a virus so only download it if you feel safe) and download/make a scores.txt file with a 0 in it.
